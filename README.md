# CS-350 Emerging Systems Architectures & Technologies

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project in this repository was designed to allow a Texas Instrument CC3220S device to flash different messages in morse code. The program was implemented as a state machine written in C.

## What did you do particularly well?
I think I did a great job with my overall design and flowchart. As per the project specification, I was required to flash the messages "SOS" and "OK". However, I avoided hardcoding these messages and instead implemented functionality that could map any text-based string into morse code symbols. I also believe that the documentation I created for this project captures that behavior very well.

## Where could you improve?
The instructor did point out that I had some memory leaks. If I were to improve this project, I would research memory management techniques in C and address these leaks. 

## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
This has been my first time working with embedded systems, so I am now adding that tool to my skillset. In the future, I may be able to revisit this area and make use of what I have learned in this class. 

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
This project required that I make heavy use of the Texas Instruments documentation for the hardware device. By doing so, I have improved my ability to read technical documentation and apply it to my own needs.

## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made sure to provide comments throughout the project in order to explain my problem, solution, and reasoning for why I took certain approaches to the problems I was solving. I have confidence that if I needed to revisit this project in the future, I could easily pick up right where I left off due to the documentation I've provided myself.
